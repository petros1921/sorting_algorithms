#C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O
This project implements various sorting algorithms in C. The algorithms covered in the project include Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Shell Sort, Cocktail Shaker Sort, Counting Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Radix Sort, Bitonic Sort, and Quick Sort with the Hoare Partition scheme. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate C function and is accompanied by a description, the algorithm's time complexity analysis, and examples of usage.

#Helper Files
print_array.c: C function that prints an array of integers.
print_list.c: C function that prints a listint_t doubly-linked list.

#Header Files
sort.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in the project.
